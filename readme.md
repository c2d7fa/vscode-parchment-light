# Parchment Light Theme for Visual Studio Code

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c2d7fa/vscode-parchment-light/master/screenshot.png)

*Parchment Light* is a theme for Visual Studio Code that makes limited use of colors for syntax highlighting. Comments are highlighted to stand out, and some colors are used in places where they make sense â€“ for example in diffs.

Inspired in part by [Your syntax highlighter is wrong](https://jameshfisher.com/2014/05/11/your-syntax-highlighter-is-wrong/).

## Building

The code generating the theme is written in Python, not JavaScript, so you'll need to build it before installing it.

Just install `pipenv` (e.g. with `pip install pipenv` if you already have `pip` installed), and then run `./build.sh`. This will build the extension into the `extension/` folder. Then you can install the extension from this folder like you would with any other extension.
